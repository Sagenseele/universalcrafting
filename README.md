# Universalcrafting

This modpack contains well-known, large mods, whether industrial mods such as Immersive Engineering or the Thermal Suite, magical mods such as Blood Magic, Thaumcraft 6, Astral Sorcery and Botania or the Harvestcraft mod for all kinds of culinary needs. Smaller quality of life mods are also a must.

There is a custom progression that weaves mods into each other and still tries to maintain the in-mod progression as much as possible.

With over 280 quests, this modpack offers long-term entertainment. An endgame is also to be implemented.

If you have any feature ideas or feedback, you can create write an issue on my [github project](https://github.com/Sagenseele/universalcrafting/issues/new/choose).
